# vault-tool-server

Utility library for spawning a HashiCorp Vault process.

This package also contains the tests for the related
[vault-tool](../vault-tool/) package (as a standard cabal test suite)

Running the test suite requires that the "vault" executable is in your `$PATH`,
or alternatively you may set the `VAULT_EXE` environment variable.
